          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <h5>Student & Engineer</h5>
          <p>I am an undergraduate junior studying Computer Science at
            Northwestern University. My interests lie in full-stack development
            and data science. I enjoy applying my passion for data and
            human-computer interaction in the lab and the classroom because each
            reflection means something. I like to design creative solutions in a
            fast-paced environment. As a proud first-generation Laotian-American
            student, I know how important it is for people to come together to
            support one another. Ever since I founded a data-driven chess league
            that brought hundreds of high school players together, I knew I could
            make an impact on the communities I am a part of by leveraging the
            technology I have available. Teamwork is one of my strengths due to
            my desire to strengthen the community. I prioritize my communication
            to facilitate feedback loops.</p>
            <p>During my free time, you can catch me cheering on my favorite
              football team, Arsenal, improvising a pop tune to a jazz rendition
              on the piano, or watching a funny TV show. I also would like to
              explore many diverse world cultures and cuisines.</p>
